## Palm rejection (Surface pro Xournalpp useful)

Simple script to have palm rejection actually working.
Some 2-in-1 devices and x86 tablets have built-in palm rejection, others do not.
As in my case of the surface pro 1, which does not have one working on ubuntu and derivatives.
I guess it's the same thing at least with the surface pro 2 because they share a lot of hardware.
Mainly useful for office programs and notes.
Some programs like xournalpp have built in this function but, at least for me it worked really badly.
When I activated pal rejection on xournalpp I had a half second delay from when the pen detached from the screen to when the touch screen actually started working again.
Disable the xournal feature and use this.
